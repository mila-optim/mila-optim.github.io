## About me

I am a Ph.D. student at [Mila](https://www.mila.quebec/") and the Université de Montréal, supervised by [Damien Scieur](https://damienscieur.com/).

One could consider my life goal as *“Understanding the real through building an abstraction that captures its essence”*. In my opinion, achieving that goal must be through math, computer science and physics. Building a theory of intelligence is a crucial part of that journey as humans make, understand, and interpret reality through their brains. For that, I like thinking about what artificial neural networks are telling us, as well as how they work using mathematical frameworks.

I am deeply convinced that a good scientist is open-minded and curious. That is why I don’t restrict myself to any particular research domain and keep learning every day (mostly related to cs, math and physics).

My current reasearch interests are: **huge-scale optimization**, **federated learning**, **distributed computing**.
